# Security Incident Response - Exposed Turnstile Secret Key

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Severity**: HIGH
**Status**: In Progress - Requires Immediate Action

---

## üö® What Happened

Your Cloudflare Turnstile Secret Key was accidentally committed to your public GitHub repository in commit `32bc1de` via the file `.env.local.backup`.

**Exposed Keys**:
- Site Key: `0x4AAAAAAB8OPOElCkZYy3aK`
- Secret Key: `0x4AAAAAAB8OPFA1KjE2lIQi2StrqtTPC04` ‚ö†Ô∏è

---

## ‚úÖ Actions Completed

1. ‚úÖ Removed `.env.local.backup` from Git tracking
2. ‚úÖ Updated `.gitignore` to prevent future accidents
3. ‚úÖ Committed the fix

---

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. Regenerate Turnstile Keys (CRITICAL - Do This NOW)

The old keys are compromised and **must be replaced immediately**.

**Steps:**

1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/
2. Click **"Turnstile"** in sidebar
3. **Option A - Create New Site (Recommended):**
   - Click **"Add site"**
   - Site name: `Kieferorthop√§die Website (New)`
   - Domains: Add your production domain + `localhost`
   - Widget mode: Managed
   - Click **"Create"**
   - **Copy the NEW Site Key and Secret Key** üìã

   **OR Option B - Rotate Existing Keys:**
   - Click on your existing site
   - Look for **"Rotate secret"** or key management
   - Generate new keys
   - **Copy the NEW keys** üìã

4. **Disable/Delete the old site** with compromised keys

---

### 2. Update Your Keys Everywhere

Once you have your NEW keys:

#### A. Update Local Environment

Edit `.env.local`:
```bash
# NEW Cloudflare Turnstile Keys (after rotation)
NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=your-new-site-key-here
TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY=your-new-secret-key-here
```

#### B. Update Vercel Environment Variables

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
4. **Edit** both variables with your NEW keys:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` = your new site key
   - `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` = your new secret key
5. Click **Save**
6. Go to **Deployments** ‚Üí **Redeploy** latest deployment

#### C. Restart Local Dev Server

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

---

### 3. Remove Secret from Git History (Advanced)

**Warning**: This will rewrite Git history. Only do this if your repository is public.

**Option A - If Others Haven't Pulled Yet (Recommended):**

```bash
# This removes the file from all history
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env.local.backup" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# Force push to GitHub (WARNING: This rewrites history)
git push origin --force --all
```

**Option B - If Repository is Already Cloned by Others:**
- Accept that the key is leaked (it's in Git history forever)
- Focus on rotating the keys (Step 1)
- The new keys will be secure

---

### 4. Push the Fix to GitHub

```bash
git push origin main
```

## üìã Checklist

- [ ] **Regenerated NEW Turnstile keys in Cloudflare** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
- [ ] **Disabled/deleted old Turnstile site with exposed keys**
- [ ] **Updated `.env.local` with NEW keys**
- [ ] **Updated Vercel environment variables with NEW keys**
- [ ] **Redeployed Vercel application**
- [ ] **Tested contact form with NEW keys (local)**
- [ ] **Tested contact form with NEW keys (production)**
- [ ] **Pushed Git fix to GitHub**
- [ ] (Optional) **Removed secret from Git history**

---

## üîí Why This Matters

With access to your secret key, someone could:
- Bypass your bot protection
- Submit spam through your contact form
- Use your Turnstile quota

**The ONLY solution is to regenerate new keys.**

---

## üìö Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
- A backup file (`.env.local.backup`) was created with sensitive keys
- This file wasn't in `.gitignore` initially
- It was committed to Git and pushed to GitHub

### Preventive Measures Implemented
‚úÖ Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.env*.backup` and `*.backup`
‚úÖ Removed backup file from Git tracking
‚úÖ Created this security incident document

### Best Practices Going Forward
1. **Never create `.backup` files with secrets** - Use environment variable management tools instead
2. **Always check `git status`** before committing
3. **Use `.gitignore` preventively** - Add patterns before creating sensitive files
4. **Rotate keys immediately** if exposed
5. **Use Git hooks** to prevent committing secrets (consider tools like `git-secrets` or `detect-secrets`)

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Additional Security Recommendations

### Implement Pre-commit Hooks

Install a pre-commit hook to scan for secrets:

```bash
# Install git-secrets
# https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets

# Or use detect-secrets
pip install detect-secrets
detect-secrets scan
```

### Use Secret Scanning Tools

- **GitHub Secret Scanning**: Enable in repository settings (if available)
- **GitGuardian**: Free tier available - https://www.gitguardian.com/
- **TruffleHog**: Open source secret scanner - https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog

### Environment Variable Management

For production projects, consider:
- **Doppler**: https://www.doppler.com/
- **Vault by HashiCorp**: https://www.vaultproject.io/
- **AWS Secrets Manager** (if using AWS)
- **Vercel Environment Variables** (built-in)
